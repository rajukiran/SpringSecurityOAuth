#Let's dive into usage
1. Letâ€™s get the tokens. First add an authorization header with client credentials [my-trusted-client/secret].
2. Click on update request, verify the header in header-tab.
3. Send the Post request, you should receive the response containing access-token as well as refresh-token.
4. Save these tokens somewhere, you will need them. Now you can use this access-token [valid for 2 minutes] to access resources.
5. After 2 minutes, access-token gets expired, your further resource requests will fail.
6. We need a new access-token. Fire a post to with refresh-token to get a brand-new access-token.
7. Use this new access-token to access the resources.
8. Refresh-token expires too[10 minutes]. After that, you should see your refresh request getting failed.
9. It means you need to request a new refresh+access-token, as in step 2.
